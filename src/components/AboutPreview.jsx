        <h2>About Sulit</h2>
        <p>
          Sulit Design Studio was created to help real small businesses get
          online with clean, aesthetic websites that feel approachable, warm,
          and modern.

        <p>
          I focus on soft colors, friendly layouts, and simple user experiences
          that make your business look good and feel trustworthy — without
          overcomplicated tech or agency pricing.
